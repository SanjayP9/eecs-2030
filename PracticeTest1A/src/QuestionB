Question 2
A.
The keyword final means that at runtime the value is stored and it cannot be changed later in the program

B.
a = ['g', 'o', 'o', 'd', 'b', 'y', 'e']
b = 

C.
The precondition of this method is that it requires for a name to be passed through as a String parameter when the method is called.
If I want to remove the precondition from this method I can do it by passing it through the constructor when an instance of Practice1A is 
created in another class or if the name doesn't change I can store the name as a final Static String in the class and then call it in the method.

D.
1st test case would be to pass through an empty list to see if the program will throw the IllegalArgumentException.
2nd test case would be just 1 character to test if the program doesn't break. This is because sometimes people expect for a regular input of multiple characters.
3rd test case would test the example given which was ['g', 'o', 'o', 'd', 'b', 'y', 'e'].
