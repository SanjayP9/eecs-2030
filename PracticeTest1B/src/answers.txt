Question 2
A.
A method precondition is a condition that the client needs to check to make sure is true
before invoking the method

B.
a = -2
b = 300a
c = -2

C.

/*
 * This method returns the last integer in the List of integers t
 * 
 * @pre. List t can't be empty
 * @param t is a non empty List of Integer's
 * @return Returns the last Integer in the List t
 */
public static Integer last(List<Integer> t) {
		return t.get(t.size() - 1);
	}
	
D.

1st test case would be to give 2 different size lists for the width and height and check to 
see if the IllegalArgumentException is thrown.

2nd test case would be a boundary test where both the width and height Lists are empty to see
if the method crashes.

3rd test case would have width list = [-1, 2, 3, 4] and height List = [1, -2, 3, 4] to check
to see if the right area is returned and to check and see if the method ignores the negative
widths and heights.
